Applied Mathematics：
To graduate,
Students must successfully complete six graduate level courses (totalling 3.0 Full Course Equivalents (FCEs)) as follows:

Two courses (1.0 FCEs) chosen from the Department of Mathematics course schedule. These must be MAT-1000 level courses or higher.

Two courses (1.0 FCEs) chosen from the Department of Computer Science’s (CSC designator) course schedule.

Two required courses (1.0 FCEs): Communication for Computer Scientists (CSC 2701H) and Technical Entrepreneurship (CSC 2702H).

An eight-month industrial internship, CSC 2703H (3.5 FCEs). The internship is coordinated by the department, and evaluated on a pass/fail basis. ‘Pass’ grades are awarded based on evaluations received from the industry/academic supervisors of the internship project and submission of an appropriately written final report, documenting the applied research internship.

Artificial Intelligence:
To graduate,
Students must successfully complete six graduate level courses (totalling 3.0 Full Course Equivalents (FCEs))* as follows:
Two courses (1.0 FCEs) must be selected from the core list of AI courses (see list below) and cover two different research areas.
One course (0.5 FCE) must be chosen from additional AI courses outside the core list.
One course (0.5 FCE) must be chosen from courses outside of AI
Two required courses (1.0 FCEs): Communication for Computer Scientists (CSC 2701H) and Technical Entrepreneurship (CSC 2702H).
Students are permitted to choose a maximum of two courses (1.0 FCEs) from outside the Computer Science graduate course listing.
